- when plotting data, do not connect the points, just show them (fig.1)

- if the theoretical value gives a better fit, why does your fitting scheme not
find it?

- why are there kinks in fig.7?

- K>115 are allowed, not below.

- beyond einstein missing.

- style: not much commenting in the code, and not much modularity either. 
it would be hard for an outsider to see what you are doing. also, you have
a veery long piece commented out in newton, which is bad for style.

- grade: 30/40
